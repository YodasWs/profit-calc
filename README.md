Profit Calculator for various games like Harvest Moon

## Preface

I love to play Harvest Moon: Animal Parade. The premise is rather simple: you inherit a
farm/ranch in a town facing destruction and you must save the town by farming. You must buy
seeds to raise crops which you can sell to make money to buy various new items. You can also
use your crops to cook new items that will sell for an even larger profit! This naturally leads
to the question, **given what I have grown, how can I maximize my profits?** This web app is my
attempt to answer that very question!

The process of developing this app will require Group Theory, a field of mathematics studied in
graduate school. When I was in university, I didn't care much for applied maths, something I am
now kicking myself for not studying more. If anyone believes studying math is not important,
then they never cared about making or saving money.

It takes years of study to begin to appreciate mathematics. True mathematics, unlike accounting
or statistics, is about finding solutions to a problem, not plugging numbers into an equation.
*This* is why i've always enjoyed mathematics and why every organization needs a mathematician.
